    <center><h1>Description</h1></center>
    This program is used to find unions of algorithms which together achieve a
    set of desired states. When all of the text areas are filled in and the
    generate unions button is clicked, two tables are created. A combo table and
    a union table. Below is a description of each input and output.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Cases</h3>
    In this box, input the entire list of algorithms that solve all pieces
    involved in the step.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Desired States</h3>
    Input the algorithms that solve the end states that you want to be able to
    solve to.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Involved Stickers</h3>
    A preset list of cube stickers are provided. If you want to ignore stickers,
    replace them all with N or any chosen character or set of characters. This
    will force the internal cube to view those stickers as all the same.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Desired Algorithms</h3>
    When generating the unions, the program will generate the first one found.
    If you want the unions to include specific algorithms, imagine a series of
    numbers, from 1 through the end, to the left of each algorithm in the Cases
    input box. In the Desired Algorithms box input the algorithm numbers you
    want and have them separated by spaces. The program will try its best to
    involve these input algorithm numbers.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Undesired Algorithms</h3>
    Input the algorithm numbers that you don't want included. If possible, the
    program will avoid involving those algorithms in the output unions.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Generate Coverage Button</h3>
    Generates the cases that each algorithm will solve to one of the desired end
    states. Taking the first line as an example: The first line corresponds with
    the first algorithm in the Cases input box. The various numbers are a
    reference to an algorithm number from that same list. If the first algorithm
    in the list is applied to any of those algorithm numbers after that number
    has been setup in reverse to produce the case, the algorithm will solve that
    case to one of the desired end states.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Generate Unions Button</h3>
    Generates the minimum algorithm numbers required to solve all possible cases
    to one of the desired end states. Each of the resulting algorithm numbers is
    capable of covering part of the entire case set. But together, the numbers
    output to the Unions text box provide full coverage of the entire set to
    solve to one of the desired end states.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Generate Table Button</h3>
    This will generate a table that provides a convenient visual of the cases
    that were input into the Cases text box and the coverage that they provide.
    It shows the case number, a 3D image, an overhead image, and the resulting
    cases for each end state.
    <br />
    <br />
    <center><h1>Example</h1></center>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Cases text area input the algorithms for all possible cases for
        the pieces that are involved. Using the COLL+1 LL method as an example,
        input all of the ZBLL algorithms. This is because in COLL+1 all of the
        corners are being solved and all four edges are involved to solve any
        single edge. Try using the below algorithms in the Cases text area.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>(U2) R' U' R U R U R U' R' U R U R2 U' R2 U R</li>
        <li>(U2) R' U' R U' R U R2 U R2 U2 R'</li>
        <li>R U R2 F' R U2 R U' R' U' R' F R2 U' R'</li>
        <li>(U2) R U' R' U' R U2 R' U2 R U R' U2 R U R'</li>
        <li>R' U2 R2 U R' U R U2 R' U2 R' U2 R</li>
        <li>(U') R2 U R' U' R' U' R U2 R' U' R2 U' R2</li>
        <li>(U') R' U2 R U R' U R</li>
        <li>(U') R2 U' R2 U' R U2 R U' R' U' R U R2</li>
        <li>R U R2 U' R2 U' R2 U2 R2 U2 R'</li>
        <li>R U R' U R U2 R'</li>
        <li>R' F' U' F U R F U R U' R' F'</li>
        <li>(U') R2 U' R' U' R2 U R U R2 U R' U R</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        In the Desired States text area input the algorithms for all of the
        desired end states. For COLL+1 this means inputting Ua Perm, Ub Perm,
        and the solved state. For the solved state, just ensure that there is a
        blank line at the bottom of the algorithm list. The algorithms must
        include all possible pre-AUFs. For COLL+1, this means having the below
        states. Try inputting them into the Desired States text area.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>U M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>U2 M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>U' M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U2 M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U' M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U</li>
        <li>U2</li>
        <li>U'</li>
        <li>Blank for the solved state</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        Click the various buttons and the coverage, unions, and table will be
        created.
      </li>

    <center><h1>Potential new features</h1></center>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The ability for the user to select how many algs they want to be
        unioned. For example, maybe they want to involve three algs in COLL+1
        instead of two.
      </li>
      <li>
        Currently the program only supports U layer symmetry for AUFs. Other
        layers could be added.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have the images represent that pieces were ignored. Instead of showing
        everything.
      </li>
      <li>Support for other puzzles.</li>
      <li>
        Maybe add a column to the table which shows the cases which the current
        alg doesn't cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Visual representations of the unions. Venn diagrams showing the set
        unions along with where each alg fits in the intersections and
        differences.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analysis features to show the number of possible unions, how many algs
        are required, and others.
      </li>
    </ul>
