    <center><h1>Description</h1></center>
    This program is used to find unions of algorithms which together achieve a
    set of desired states. When all of the text areas are filled in and the
    generate unions button is clicked, two tables are created. A combo table and
    a union table.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Combo Table</h3>
    The left four columns which have the "Cases" header show information about
    all of the possible cases for the pieces. The case number, two different
    images, and the algorithm which solves the case in the current row. The next
    series of columns which have the "Desired end states and resulting
    combinations" header show the desired end states and which case it produces
    when crossed with the case algorithm from the fourth column of the current
    row. The inverse of the desired state is applied to the solved state then
    the inverse of the case algorithm is applied to that. The result is a number
    which is one of the cases from the left side. The next column is "Cases this
    case covers". This shows all of the cases which, if the algorithm in the
    current row is applied to that case state, will produce one of the desired
    end states. An algorithm likely won't be able to produce one of the states
    for every possible case. That's where the unions come in. The final column
    is "This case unions with". The numbers here show the cases which can be in
    a union to reach the desired end state in all possible cases. Example for
    the final two columns: Let's say you are looking at row 1 (case 1) and there
    is a series of numbers such as "1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10" in the "Cases
    this case covers" column. This means that the algorithm in row 1 can solve
    to one of the desired states if it is used on any of the cases in that list.
    But for the numbers not in the list, it can't reach one of the desired
    states. Applying the algorithm to one of those missing numbers leads to some
    other case which isn't cared about. For the remaining numbers, you need an
    algorithm which can solve to one of the desired end states. The final column
    ("This case unions with") shows the algorithms which cover the missing
    numbers. A list of numbers will be contained here such as "3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
    9, 10". Each of those case numbers contain all of the numbers that are
    missing from cases which the current row case can't cover.

    <h3>Union Table</h3>
    This table shows all of the possible unions. It is the individual unions
    separated out of the final column of the combo table.
    <center><h1>How to use</h1></center>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the first text area input the algorithms for all possible cases for
        the pieces that are involved. Using the COLL+1 LL method as an example,
        input all of the ZBLL algorithms. This is because in COLL+1 all of the
        corners are being solved and all four edges are involved to solve any
        single edge. Try using the below algorithms in the Cases input box.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>(U2) R' U' R U R U R U' R' U R U R2 U' R2 U R</li>
        <li>(U2) R' U' R U' R U R2 U R2 U2 R'</li>
        <li>R U R2 F' R U2 R U' R' U' R' F R2 U' R'</li>
        <li>(U2) R U' R' U' R U2 R' U2 R U R' U2 R U R'</li>
        <li>R' U2 R2 U R' U R U2 R' U2 R' U2 R</li>
        <li>(U') R2 U R' U' R' U' R U2 R' U' R2 U' R2</li>
        <li>(U') R' U2 R U R' U R</li>
        <li>(U') R2 U' R2 U' R U2 R U' R' U' R U R2</li>
        <li>R U R2 U' R2 U' R2 U2 R2 U2 R'</li>
        <li>R U R' U R U2 R'</li>
        <li>R' F' U' F U R F U R U' R' F'</li>
        <li>(U') R2 U' R' U' R2 U R U R2 U R' U R</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        In the second text area input the algorithms for all of the desired end
        states. For COLL+1 this means inputting Ua Perm, Ub Perm, and the solved
        state. For the solved state, just ensure that there is a blank line at
        the bottom of the algorithm list. The algorithms must include all
        possible pre-AUFs. For COLL+1, this means having the below states. Try
        inputting them into the Desired States input box.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>U M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>U2 M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>U' M2 U M' U2 M U M2</li>
        <li>M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U2 M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U' M2 U' M' U2 M U' M2</li>
        <li>U</li>
        <li>U2</li>
        <li>U'</li>
        <li>Blank for the solved state</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        In the third text area input the pieces that are involved. A complete
        list of pieces is included, so just delete the ones that you want to
        ignore. The piece notation uses NBRS. For example, UFM means the UF edge
        and UMS means the U layer center.
      </li>

    <center><h1>Potential new features</h1></center>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The ability for the user to select how many algs they want to be
        unioned. For example, maybe they want to involve three algs in COLL+1
        instead of two.
      </li>
      <li>
        Currently the program only supports U layer symmetry for AUFs. Other
        layers could be added.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have the images represent that pieces were ignored. Instead of showing
        everything.
      </li>
      <li>Support for other puzzles.</li>
      <li>
        Maybe add a column to the table which shows the cases which the current
        alg doesn't cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Visual representations of the unions. Venn diagrams showing the set
        unions along with where each alg fits in the intersections and
        differences.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analysis features to show the number of possible unions, how many algs
        are required, and others.
      </li>
    </ul>
